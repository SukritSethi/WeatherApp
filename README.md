# WeatherApp

Buit my first project involving an API other than unsplash (:P) and I chose to make a weather displaying web app. For this project, I learned about Javascript and dove deep into CSS styling.

The following project has been made following the youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZNG8UomjSI&ab_channel=JonahLawrence%E2%80%A2DevProTips

Appreciate all the constructive feedbacks :)
